/**
 * GpmBot — Step-by-Step Journey Guide (Voice-Activated)
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Greets the user on mount with the active bot's arrival greeting
 * - Displays journey steps in a vertical scroll window
 * - Active step: full contrast, animated pulse ring, bold label
 * - Previous steps (above): dimmed, ✓ check mark, still visible
 * - Next steps (below): dimmed, numbered, peeking to invite scroll
 * - User advances via "Next Step" button, keyboard (→), or VOICE COMMAND
 * - Voice commands: "next" / "back" / "go" / "done" / "collapse" / "expand"
 * - Can collapse to a compact bot-chip to stay non-intrusive
 *
 * Props:
 * bot - which bot persona to use (default: 'MC-BOT')
 * steps - optional custom journey steps (defaults to JOURNEY_PROTOCOL)
 * onStepChange - optional callback fired when activeStep changes
