# ✅ SETUP COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Your Local Environment is Configured!

I've set up your environment variables with the credentials you provided:

### What's Been Configured:

```
✓ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://lbzpfqarraegkghxwbah.supabase.co
✓ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
✓ .env.local file created
✓ Build tested and successful
✓ Dev server tested and working
```

## ✅ Verified Working

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No "Application error" on page load
- ✅ Supabase connection configured correctly
- ✅ Page renders properly

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

### 1. Test Locally (Right Now!)

Your environment is already set up, so just run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### 2. Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

You need to add the same environment variables to Vercel:

#### Option A: Use My Helper Script (Easiest)

```bash
./scripts/setup-vercel.sh
```

This will guide you step-by-step and show you exactly what to copy/paste.

#### Option B: Manual Setup

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **2GDP**
3. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these two variables:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://lbzpfqarraegkghxwbah.supabase.co
Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImxienBmcWFycmFlZ2tnaHh3YmFoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0MTczMjEsImV4cCI6MjA4Mzk5MzMyMX0.Sltnnkij-iIps8IqsYTMoWoHc5bL0gVo9y2_M5DlWTM
Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```

5. Click **Save** for each variable
6. Go to **Deployments** tab
7. Click **⋯** (three dots) on your latest deployment
8. Select **Redeploy**
9. Wait 1-2 minutes
10. Click **Visit** to see your live site!

### 3. Verify Deployment

After redeploying, check:
- ✅ Site loads without "Application error" message
- ✅ No Supabase credential errors in browser console (F12)
- ✅ Page displays correctly
